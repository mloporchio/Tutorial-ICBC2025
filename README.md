# Set Accumulators and their Applications to Blockchain Systems

This repository contains the source code for the examples shown during the tutorial "Set Accumulators and their Applications to Blockchain Systems", presented by Matteo Loporchio at IEEE ICBC 2025 - 7th International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency.

# Modules

The code is organized into two main modules:

- `bilinear`: This module contains an example showing how to instantiate a bilinear accumulator scheme using the Cryptimeleon Java library.

- `spatial`: This module contains code for the implementation of a Merkle R-tree, an authenticated data structure that can be used to store and query spatial data efficiently.

# Requirements

To run the code, Java 11 or higher is required. The code has been tested with Oracle JDK 24.0.1.
